BinjR

Created by: Steven Sroczynski, Josh Zink, Nick Marchese and Robert Helmick

This web app was created as a week 10 group project at Skill Distillery. The app allows for users to keep track of TV shows that they watch. When users finish watching an episode of their favorite TV shows, they can log in to their BinjR account and mark the episode as "watched". The users are also able to create groups where they can connect with their friends, allowing for users to view their friend's watched list.

The technologies used include Java, HTLM5, CSS, Spring MVC, Tomcat 8, JSP/JSTL, AWS, Spring Tool Suite, and MySQLWorkbench.

BingeSync

Created by: Steven Sroczynski, Josh Zink, Nick Marchese and Robert Helmick

Using agile methodology, this web app was created as a week 10 group project at Skill Distillery. The app allows for users to keep track of their favorite TV shows, which episodes they have watched, and which episodes their friends have watched. When users finish watching an episode, they can log in to their BingeSync account and mark the episode as "watched". Users are encouraged to connect with their friends by creating a group, which allows users to see which episodes of a TV show their group has watched.

The technologies used include Java, HTLM5, CSS3, Spring MVC, Tomcat 8, JPA, JSP, AWS, Spring Tool Suite, MySQLWorkbench, and Bootstrap Studio.
